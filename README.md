Explanation of the GUI
The grid shows the positions of all agents. Blue dots represent Identity Agents, red dots represent Security Agents, and green dots represent Hospital Agents.
You can start, stop, and step through the simulation using the controls at the top of the page.
The chart below the grid shows the total number of agents over time.
You can adjust the initial parameters of the simulation using the controls on the right side of the page.
This graphical interface will make it much easier to visualize and understand the behavior of your multi-agent system. You can further customize the visualization by adding more charts, changing the appearance of agents, or adding more interactive elements as needed for your specific simulation requirements.# identity_security_system
